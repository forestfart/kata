Rules
Lift Rules
The Lift only goes up or down!
Each floor has both UP and DOWN Lift-call buttons (except top and ground floors which have only DOWN and UP respectively)
The Lift never changes direction until there are no more people wanting to get on/off in the direction it is already travelling
When empty the Lift tries to be smart. For example,
If it was going up then it may continue up to collect the highest floor person wanting to go down
If it was going down then it may continue down to collect the lowest floor person wanting to go up
The Lift has a maximum capacity of people
When called, the Lift will stop at a floor even if it is full, although unless somebody gets off nobody else can get on!
If the lift is empty, and no people are waiting, then it will return to the ground floor
People Rules
People are in "queues" that represent their order of arrival to wait for the Lift
All people can press the UP/DOWN Lift-call buttons
Only people going the same direction as the Lift may enter it, and they do so according to their "queue" order
If a person is unable to enter a full Lift, they will press the UP/DOWN Lift-call button again after it has departed without them
Kata Task
Get all the people to the floors they want to go to while obeying the Lift rules and the People rules
Return a list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)
NOTE: The Lift always starts on the ground floor (and people waiting on the ground floor may enter immediately)

People wanting to go to floors that do not exist
People wanting to take the Lift to the floor they are already on
Buildings with < 2 floors
Basements
Output
A list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)
